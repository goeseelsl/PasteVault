# Simplified Paste Implementation

## What Changed

### Reverted to Simple Approach
Instead of complex CGEvent and AppleScript implementations, I've reverted to a simple approach:

1. **Press Enter** → **Copy to Pasteboard** → **User presses Cmd+V manually**

### Key Changes Made:

1. **Simplified `performPasteOperation`**:
   - Removed complex CGEvent and AppleScript logic
   - Now just copies content to pasteboard using existing `copyToPasteboard` method
   - Returns immediately after copying

2. **Improved Image Handling**:
   - Enhanced `copyToPasteboard` to use `NSImage.writeObjects()` for better image compatibility
   - Fallback to raw TIFF data if image creation fails
   - Better logging for debugging

3. **Fixed Core Data Properties**:
   - Removed duplicate `image` property declaration
   - Using existing `image` property from CoreDataProperties

4. **Updated UI Flow**:
   - ContentView now shows "ready for manual paste with Cmd+V" message
   - Clearer user feedback about what to do next

## How It Works Now

```
User presses Enter → Close popover → Copy to pasteboard → User presses Cmd+V
```

### For Text Items:
- Copies text content to pasteboard using `NSPasteboard.setString()`
- User can then paste anywhere with Cmd+V

### For Image Items:
- Uses `NSImage.writeObjects()` for better compatibility
- Supports multiple image formats automatically
- Fallback to TIFF format if needed

## Benefits

1. **Reliable**: No dependency on accessibility permissions or system events
2. **Simple**: Uses standard pasteboard operations
3. **Compatible**: Works with all applications
4. **Debuggable**: Clear logging at each step
5. **Fast**: Immediate response when pressing Enter

## Testing

1. Run the app
2. Copy some text and images to build clipboard history
3. Open clipboard manager
4. Navigate with arrow keys
5. Press Enter on any item
6. Check console for "✅ Item copied to pasteboard" message
7. Switch to target app and press Cmd+V to paste

The simplified approach is much more reliable and doesn't require complex system event handling.
