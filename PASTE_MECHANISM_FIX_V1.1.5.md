ðŸ”§ PASTE FUNCTIONALITY FIX - Version 1.1.5
===============================================

## Issue Identified
The Enter key was **copying items to clipboard** instead of **pasting them where the cursor is** because there were two conflicting paste mechanisms:

1. **OLD mechanism** (PinnedItemsSection): `copyToPasteboard()` + manual Cmd+V simulation
2. **NEW mechanism** (Enter key): `performPasteOperation()` with proper focus restoration

## Root Cause
The `onPasteItem` handler in PinnedItemsSection was using the old copy-then-simulate-paste approach:
- Called `clipboardManagerInstance.copyToPasteboard(item: item)`
- Manually created CGEvent for Cmd+V keypress
- This only copied to clipboard but didn't properly paste

## Solution Applied
âœ… **Unified paste mechanism**: Both Enter key and PinnedItemsSection now use `clipboardManager.performPasteOperation()`
âœ… **Removed old paste simulation**: Eliminated manual Cmd+V event generation
âœ… **Enhanced debugging**: Added comprehensive logging to track paste operations
âœ… **Fixed syntax errors**: Cleaned up leftover code from old mechanism

## Files Modified
- `ContentView.swift`: Fixed PinnedItemsSection onPasteItem handler
- `build.sh`: Updated to version 1.1.5

## Technical Details
The proper paste flow now follows this sequence:
1. User presses Enter or clicks paste button
2. `clipboardManager.performPasteOperation()` is called
3. Focus restoration occurs first (`PasteHelper.restorePreviousAppFocus()`)
4. Actual paste operation executes via PasteHelper delegation
5. Content is pasted at current cursor position

## Testing
- âœ… Build completed successfully
- âœ… DMG created: ClipboardManager.dmg (1.2M)
- ðŸ”„ Ready for user testing

## Next Steps
1. Install from DMG
2. Test Enter key paste functionality
3. Verify paste occurs at cursor position (not just clipboard copy)
4. Monitor debug output if needed with `./monitor_debug.sh`

## Expected Behavior
- Enter key should now **paste content at cursor position**
- No more "copying to clipboard" behavior
- Proper focus restoration and paste execution
