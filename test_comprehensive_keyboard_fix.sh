echo "🔧 Testing Comprehensive Keyboard Shortcut Fix"
echo "============================================="

echo "✅ Root Cause Identified:"
echo "- App has TWO keyboard shortcut systems:"
echo "  1. HotkeysManager (Carbon-based) - handles Cmd+Shift+C"
echo "  2. GlobalShortcutsManager (NSEvent-based) - handles other shortcuts"
echo "- The HotkeysManager was being disabled during paste but not properly re-enabled"
echo ""
echo "✅ Comprehensive Fix Applied:"
echo "- Fixed HotkeysManager.reenable() function to properly re-register hotkeys"
echo "- Added proper notification coordination for both systems"
echo "- ClipboardManager now posts both .disableGlobalHotkeys and .enableGlobalHotkeys"
echo "- Both systems are temporarily disabled during paste operations"
echo "- Both systems are properly re-enabled after paste operations"
echo ""
echo "🧪 Test Scenarios:"
echo "1. Press Cmd+Shift+C to toggle sidebar (should work immediately)"
echo "2. Click an item to paste (should work immediately)"
echo "3. Press Cmd+Shift+C after clicking (should work on FIRST press)"
echo "4. Select an item and press Enter to paste"
echo "5. Press Cmd+Shift+C after Enter (should work on FIRST press)"
echo "6. Repeat multiple times to verify consistency"
echo ""
echo "🔍 Console Output to Monitor:"
echo "- '🔄 HotkeysManager: Temporarily disabling hotkeys'"
echo "- '🔄 HotkeysManager: Re-enabling hotkeys'"
echo "- '🔄 Temporarily disabling shortcuts for paste operation'"
echo "- '🔄 Re-enabling shortcuts after paste operation'"
echo "- '🔄 Reinitializing event monitors for better reliability'"
echo ""
echo "✅ Expected Result: Cmd+Shift+C should work immediately after ANY paste operation"
echo "❌ Previous Issue: Required double-press after paste operations (both click and Enter)"
