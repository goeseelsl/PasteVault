echo "🔧 Testing Improved Timing Fix for Keyboard Shortcuts"
echo "===================================================="

echo "✅ Timing Fix Applied:"
echo "- Increased delay before re-enabling GlobalShortcutsManager (0.3s)"
echo "- Staggered re-enabling: GlobalShortcutsManager first, then HotkeysManager"
echo "- Added 0.2s delay between the two systems"
echo "- Improved reinitializeEventMonitors with proper cleanup"
echo "- Better logging for event monitor setup"
echo ""
echo "🎯 Expected Behavior:"
echo "- Cmd+Shift+C should work on FIRST press after paste operations"
echo "- No more double-press required after 'Reinitializing event monitors'"
echo "- Better coordination between the two keyboard shortcut systems"
echo ""
echo "🧪 Test Process:"
echo "1. Press Cmd+Shift+C to open sidebar"
echo "2. Click or press Enter on an item to paste"
echo "3. Wait for console messages to complete"
echo "4. Press Cmd+Shift+C immediately - should work on first press"
echo "5. Repeat multiple times to verify consistency"
echo ""
echo "🔍 Console Output to Monitor:"
echo "- '🔧 Setting up global shortcuts...'"
echo "- '✅ Global shortcuts setup complete'"
echo "- '✅ Event monitors reinitialized successfully'"
echo "- '🔍 Global shortcut detected: keyCode=8' for Cmd+Shift+C"

echo "🚀 Starting app with improved timing..."
